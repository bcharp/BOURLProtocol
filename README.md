BOURLProtocol
=============

Mock network call easily

This two little files help manage asynchronous testing or more generaly, mocking of network call.
It is made with the idea of working with AFNetworking.
Based on NSURLProtocol.

A full project with test and exemple will be made before the 28/02/13
(actually the code is test driven, so it's mostly cleaning files)

Don't hesitate to send me an email for more information until then : boris.charpentier@gmail.com

Quick Exemple with GHAsyncTestCase : 

```objc
- (void)test_retrieve_protocolLOAD
{
    // Given
    [BOURLProtocol registerSpecialProtocol];
    [BOURLProtocol stubPath:@"/categories.json" load:[[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] URLForResource:@"categories" withExtension:@"json"]];
    // When
    [self prepare];
    
    [[MyAPIClient sharedClient] getPath:@"/categories.json" parameters:nil success:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject) {
        
      //responseObject is made with the categories.json file in my app.
        
    } failure:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {

        
    }];

    
    [self waitForStatus:kGHUnitWaitStatusSuccess timeout:10];
    
    // Then
    
    [BOURLProtocol unregisterSpecialProtocol];
}
```
